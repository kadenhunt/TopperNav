Also, explain how the group is progressing with assigned tasks and how that progress is shared with the client.  Examples:  how does the group assign tasks?  How to group members know tasks assigned to them?  How do group members communicate when assigned tasks are complete, need assistance, or waiting on other tasks to be completed first?

%---------------------------Risk Management--------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Risk Management}
%Use this section to describe the team's approach to risk management.

\subsection{Risk Identification}
%List, categorize, and prioritize all potential risks associated with the project.
The following risks are listed and categorized by potential risk level.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Performance (High Priority):} The database may become too slow under heavy loads, affecting responsiveness and user experience.
    \item \textbf{Route Generation API Failure (High Priority):} The external route generation API may not function as expected, preventing key functionality of the application.
    \item \textbf{Compatibility Issues (Medium Priority):} The system may encounter compatibility problems across different devices, operating systems, or software versions.
    \item \textbf{Access to Android Phones (Medium Priority):} Limited availability of Android devices for testing may hinder progress.
    \item \textbf{Large File Download (Low Priority):} Users may face issues when downloading or uploading large files, leading to performance bottlenecks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Planning}
%Give overviews of plans for specific risk types
The team has outlined the following plans for risk planning:

\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Database Performance:} Implement query optimization, proper indexing, and caching strategies. Load testing will be performed early to identify bottlenecks.
    \item \textbf{Route Generation API Failure:} Identify and test backup APIs during early development. 
    \item \textbf{Compatibility Issues:} Use emulators and virtual machines to ensure broader compatibility across various platforms.
    \item \textbf{Access to Android Phones:} Gain access to an android phone temporarily and share them among team members as needed. 
    \item \textbf{Large File Download:} Implement file compression. Clearly communicate file size limitations to users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Monitoring}
%Give overviews of how the team will monitor specific types of risks
The following monitoring strategies will be used for the remaining duration of the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Performance:} Monitor query execution times and system performance.
    \item \textbf{Route Generation API Failure:} Implement automated alerts for API failures or unusual latency.
    \item \textbf{Compatibility Issues:} Maintain a compatibility checklist and update it with each system change.
    \item \textbf{Access to Android Phones:} Track device usage and availability within the team. .
    \item \textbf{Large File Download:} Monitor client feedback related to file transfers.
\end{itemize}
